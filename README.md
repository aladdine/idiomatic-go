# Meeting Go

Go was started in 2007 by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson. It was announced in November 2009.

## Key Features

The language was designed with three objectives in mind:

### Expressiveness and simplicity:

According to Rob Pike, languages now tend to copy features from each other \(e.g. classes in JavaScript\). This has lead to languages with many features which makes them more complex to use: there are many ways of achieving the same thing. Also, Rob argues that languages are increasingly becoming similar because of the similarity in their features. That said, Go was designed for simplicity and expressiveness. To achieve these, the developers of Go opted for including only the minimum necessary features. It is expected that Go will not have major changes to its feature set. As a result, one key feature of the Go language is backward compatibility. 

Below is a list of features that exist in most mainstream languages but not in Go: 

* no implicit numeric conversion,
* no constructors or destructors,
* no concept for classes,
* no default values for function arguments,
* no inheritance,
* no generics,
* no exceptions,
* no function annotations,
* a basic type system,
* the for loop is the only looping mechanism supported \(no while and do/while loops, no array filters, no array maps\).

The gopher logo of the language \(a simple drawing of a gopher\) is meant to illustrate this philosophy

### Efficient compilation:

Compilation time is often better than dynamically typed languages.

### Efficient execution.

## Inspiration

### C: 

* syntax,
* control-flow statements,
* basic data types,
* pointers,
* compile efficiently to machine code

### Modula-2/Oberon-2:

packages/modules/imports.

### CSP/Squeak/Newsqueak/Alef:

* concurrency

### APL:

* iota

### Scheme:

* lexical scope,
* nested functions
* Ideal usage is networked apps.
