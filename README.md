# Meeting Go

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aladdine/idiomatic-go/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```text
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aladdine/idiomatic-go/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

Go was started in 2007 by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson. It was announced in November 2009.

## Key Features

The language was designed with three objectives in mind:

### Expressiveness and simplicity:

This can be seen in its lack of features which one can find in most mainstream languages. These include: 

* no implicit numeric conversion,
* no constructors or destructors,
* no concept for classes,
* no default values for function arguments,
* no inheritance,
* no generics,
* no exceptions,
* no function annotations,
* basic type system.
* the for loop is the only looping mechanism supported \(no while and do/while loops\). 

### Efficient compilation:

Compilation time is often better than dynamically typed languages.

### Efficient execution.

## Inspiration

### C: 

* syntax,
* control-flow statements,
* basic data types,
* pointers,
* compile efficiently to machine code

### Modula-2/Oberon-2:

packages/modules/imports.

### CSP/Squeak/Newsqueak/Alef:

* concurrency

### APL:

* iota

### Scheme:

* lexical scope,
* nested functions
* Ideal usage is networked apps.
